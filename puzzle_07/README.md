# Design

## Library
* use of a [generic function](http://www.ada-auth.org/standards/12rm/html/RM-12-1.html) definition to implement as an (almost) standard library.

## Algorithms

For now the minimum is computed through brute force ... (basic iteration).

Some could code others linear algorithms ðŸ˜‰

## Loading of the data file

* Did some tweek on the data by replacing `,` with ` ` so as to have a plain use of `Integer_IO`.

## Running the program

* Parameter `LINEAR` OR `PROGRESSIVE` passed on the command-line permit you to change the way fuel consumption is computed.
